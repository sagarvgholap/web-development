## What i have learnt By working on this project
1. I have improved my self in reserching on the internet
2. Got a good understanding on displaying bg images
3. I was stuck when the quality of the image was decreased and the main-content (hammer) was not visible. I resolved the solution after visiting and researching for some time in stack overflow and mdn web documentation
4. I had some fun with `flex` properties

## Honest Time to finish the project

I had took about 45min approximately as i was not tracking the time this project was a bit tougher for me from the other ones as it forced me to know how to select siblings without class, attribute or id selector
